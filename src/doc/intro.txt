Streams represent a sequence of data items, which can be operated on
one at a time. Thus, it is possible to operate on a large sequence of
items without loading them into memory.

This library extends the
{{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Stream.html}standard
library's Stream module} with several practical functions. CFStream
stands for "Core-friendly Stream". The library is so named because the
API follows the
{{:https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/}Core standard
library's} style, e.g. labeled arguments are used. It is also inspired
by
{{:http://ocaml-batteries-team.github.com/batteries-included/hdoc2/BatEnum.html}Batteries's
[Enum] module}.

The implementation is useful for beginners and simple scripts. Robust
high-performance software should instead use
{{:http://ocsigen.org/lwt/}Lwt} or
{{:https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/async_core/index.html}Async}.

Recommended usage is to do [open CFStream].
