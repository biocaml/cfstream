(** [from f] returns a stream whose [n]th element is determined by
    calling [f n], which should return [Some x] to indicate value [x]
    or [None] to indicate the end of the stream. The stream is
    infinite if [f] never returns None. *)
val from : (int -> 'a option) -> 'a t

(** Return a stream of characters by reading from the input
    channel. WARNING: Semantics unclear if the channel is closed
    before the stream reads all of its input. For example, the stream
    appears to return values although the channel has been closed. *)
val of_channel : in_channel -> char t

(** Return a stream of strings from the input. Each string has length
    at most [buffer_size]. *)
val strings_of_channel : ?buffer_size:int -> in_channel -> string t

(** [range p until:q] creates a stream of integers [[p, p+1, ..., q]].
    If [until] is omitted, the enumeration is not bounded. Behaviour
    is not-specified once [max_int] has been reached.*)
val range : ?until:int -> int -> int t

(** The empty stream. *)
val empty : unit -> 'a t

(** [init n f] returns the stream [f 0; f 1; ... f (n-1)]. *)
val init : int -> f:(int -> 'a) -> 'a t

(** [singleton x] returns a stream containing the single value [x]. *)
val singleton : 'a -> 'a t

(** [unfold a0 f] returns the stream [b0; b1; ...; bn], where

    - [Some (b0, a1) = f a0],
    - [Some (b1, a2) = f a1],
    - ...
    - [Some (bn, a(n+1)) = f an],
    - [None = f a(n+1)]

    The stream is infinite if [f] never returns None. *)

(** Indexed variant of [unfold] *)
val unfoldi : 'a -> f:(int -> 'a -> ('b * 'a) option) -> 'b t

val of_lazy : 'a t lazy_t -> 'a t

(** {6 Iterators}
    Unless otherwise stated, functions in this section normally
    consume the entire stream. The exception is if a caller supplied
    function raises an exception, but that is not the normal intention
    of supplied functions.
*)

(** Like [iter] but operates on two streams. Stops when either stream
    becomes empty. *)

(** [fold xs ~init ~f] returns [f (...(f (f init x0) x1)...) xn], that

    - b1 = f init a0

    and returns [bn]

val fold : 'a t -> init:'b -> f:('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b

(** Like [fold] but operates on two streams. Processing continues
    until either stream becomes empty. *)
val fold2 : 'a t -> 'b t -> init:'c -> f:('c -> 'a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c

(** Like [fold2] except streams required to be of equal length.

    different lengths, in which case there is no guarantee about which
    elements were consumed. *)
val fold2_exn : 'a t -> 'b t -> init:'c -> f:('c -> 'a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c

(** Like [fold] but all intermediate values are returned, not just the
    final value. If given stream [s] is [a0; a1; ...], then [scanl f
    init s] is the stream containing

    - b0 = init
    - b1 = f b0 a0
    - b2 = f b1 a1
    - ...
. *)
val scanl : 'a t -> init:'b -> f:('b -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b t

(** [scan] is similar to [scanl] but without the [init] value: if [s]
    contains [x0], [x1], [x2] ..., [scan s ~f] contains

    - y0 = x0
    - y1 = f y0 x1
    - y2 = f y1 x2
    - ...

    For instance, [scan (1 -- 10) ~f:( * )] will produce an
    enumeration containing the successive values of the factorial
    function. Returns an empty stream if the input stream is empty as
    well. *)
val scan : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a t


(** Indexed variants of the previous higher-order functions. The index
    provided to the [~f] argument is the count of the stream, that is
    the number of discarded elements before the reaching the current
    one. For functions iterating on two streams, the [~f] is thus
    provided two indices, since the current count may differ from one
    stream to another. *)

val reduce : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'a -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [reduce xs ~f] returns [f (...(f (f x1 x2) x3)...) xn] *)

(** [sum xs] returns the sum of the integers contained in [xs] *)

val fsum : float t -> float
(** [fsum xs] returns the sum of the floats contained in [xs] *)


(** {6 Scanners}
    Operations that scan a stream for various purposes. Unlike
    iterators, these operations are not inherently meant to consume
    streams, although they do partially or fully, due to the nature of
    streams.
*)

(** [exists s ~f] returns [true] if there is some [x] in [s] such that
    [f x] is true. The stream is consumed through and including
    [x]. *)
val exists: 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool

(** [for_all s ~f] returns [true] if [f x] is true for every [x] in
    [s]. *)
val for_all: 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> bool

(** [find e ~f] returns either [Some x] where [x] is the first
    element of [e] such that [f x] returns [true], consuming the
    stream up to and including the found element, or [None] if no
    such element exists in the stream, consuming the whole stream in
    the search.

    Since [find] (eagerly) consumes a prefix of the stream, it
    can be used several times on the same stream to find the
    next element. *)
val find : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a option

(** Same as [find] except that it raises an exception [Not_found]
    instead of returning [None]. *)
val find_exn : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a

(** Similar to [find] *)
val find_map : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b option) -> 'b option


(** {6 Converters}
    Extract a subset of a stream or map a stream into another type of
    stream.
*)

(** [take xs ~n] builds a fresh stream from [xs] containing the [d]
    first elements of [xs] where [d = min n l] and [l] is the length
    of [xs]. As it is fresh, the count of the resulting stream starts
    from [0] whatever the count of [xs] is. *)
val take : 'a t -> n:int -> 'a t

(** Same as [take] but takes elements from the input enum as long as
    [f] evaluates to [true]. *)
val take_while : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t

(** [drop xs ~n] is equivalent to calling [n] times [junk] on [xs]. *)
val drop : 'a t -> n:int -> unit

(** Similar to [drop]: [drop_while xs ~f] removes elements from [xs]
    and stops when [f] evals to false on the head element. *)
val drop_while : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> unit

(** Similar to [drop] but returns a fresh stream obtained after
    discarding the [n] first elements. Being a fresh stream, the count
    of the returned stream starts from 0. Beware though, that the
    input and output streams are consuminmg the same resource, so
    consuming one modify the other. *)
val skip : 'a t -> n:int -> 'a t

(** Similar to [skip]: [skip_while xs ~f] removes elements from [xs]
    and stops when [f] evals to false on the head element. *)
val skip_while : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t

(** Indexed variants of the previous prefix/suffix constructors *)
val take_whilei : 'a t -> f:(int -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t

val skip_whilei : 'a t -> f:(int -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t

val span : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t * 'a t
(** [span test e] produces two streams [(hd, tl)], such that
    [hd] is the same as [take_while test e] and [tl] is the same
    as [skip_while test e]. *)

val group : 'a t -> f:('a -> 'b) -> 'a t t
(** [group xs f] applies [f] to the elements of [xs] and distribute
    them according to the return value of [f]. Let [ys] = [group xs
    f], then [xs] = [concat ys] and in each stream [s] of [ys], all
    values give the same value with [f]. *)

val group_by : 'a t -> eq:('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a t t
(** Same as [group] but with a comparison function instead of a
    mapping. *)

val mapi : 'a t -> f:(int -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'b t
val filter : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t

val append : 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
val concat : 'a t t -> 'a t

val combine : 'a t * 'b t -> ('a * 'b) t
(** [combine] transforms a pair of streams into a stream of pairs of
    corresponding elements. If one stream is short, excess elements
    of the longer stream are ignored. *)

val uncombine : ('a * 'b) t -> 'a t * 'b t
  (** [uncombine] is the opposite of [combine] *)

val merge : 'a t -> 'a t -> cmp:('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a t
  (** [merge test (a, b)] merge the elements from [a] and [b] into a
      single stream. At each step, [test] is applied to the first
      element of [a] and the first element of [b] to determine which
      should get first into the resulting stream. If [a] or [b]
      runs out of elements, the process will append all elements of
      the other stream to the result.  *)

val partition : 'a t -> f:('a -> bool) -> 'a t * 'a t
  (** [partition e ~f] splits [e] into two streams, where the first
      stream have all the elements satisfying [f], the second stream
      is opposite. The order of elements in the source stream is
      preserved. *)

val uniq : 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [uniq e] returns a duplicate of [e] with repeated values
      omitted. (similar to unix's [uniq] command) *)
